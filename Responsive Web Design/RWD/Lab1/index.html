            the number of fake words you'd like to see and then hit the button.

          Proper Nouns are unique nouns and usually capitalized. Examples:
          Germany, January, Nebraska, White House. Common Nouns refer to
          general, unspecific categories of entities. Examples: country, month,
          university. Countable Nouns are all nouns which can be pluralized.
          Examples: bike, dog, car, university. Uncountable Nouns (also known as
          Mass Nouns) are nouns which don't have plurals. Examples: weather,
          happiness, milk, air. Collective Nouns are nouns that refer to a group
          of something. Examples: gaggle, bevy, team, faculty. Concrete Nouns
          refer to real things that can be touched, smelled, seen or tasted.
          Examples: animal, flower, computer, car. Abstract Nouns refer to
          theoretical concepts. Examples: freedom, love, brightness. Pronouns
          are types of nouns that can be used instead of nouns. Examples: he,
          she, them.
